### Description

This code builds on the PC Calendar submitted by Johnathan Fullman

<br>

The new version includes:

<br>

-Microsoft Agent Intergration

<br>

-Streamlined Interface

<br>

-A few tweaks, and bug fixes

<br>

You can do a whole lot more with agent, then i've demonstrated in this app, and really add some cool functionality.

<br>Kudos to Johnathan for making a great calendar app.

<br>(Be sure to download the Microsoft agent components from http://msdn.microsoft.com/msagnet.

You'll need the agent runtime, the merlin character, and the text to speech engine. Most new computers come pre-installed with agent.)

<br>UPDATED!!! New version includes compelling new personalization features, usability improvements, tighter agent intergration, bug fixes, and some minor interface tweaks. Please leave any comments you have.
